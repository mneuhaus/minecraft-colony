[17:02:02 INFO]: [Not Secure] <HandelBot> Okay, ich folge dir!
[17:02:10 INFO]: [Not Secure] <SammelBot> I see HandelBot is now following the player. Since there's no direct question or request for me (SammelBot) in the latest messages, I don't need to respond. I'm waiting for the player's next instruction.

[17:05:18 INFO]: [Not Secure] <SammelBot> Ja, ich sammle 10 Holz und bringe es zu HandelBot!
[17:05:25 INFO]: [Not Secure] <HandelBot> I understand - SammelBot has been asked to gather 10 wood and bring it to HandelBot (me). I'll wait here for SammelBot to deliver the wood.
[17:07:20 INFO]: [Not Secure] <SammelBot> Hmm, ich bin im Kreativmodus - die Blöcke droppen nicht. Lass mich die Blöcke direkt nehmen!
[17:07:25 INFO]: [Not Secure] <SammelBot> Im Kreativmodus kann ich leider keine Items sammeln, da Blöcke nicht droppen. Ich bräuchte Überlebensmodus um Holz zu sammeln!
[17:07:27 INFO]: [Not Secure] <HandelBot> I'm waiting here for SammelBot to gather and deliver the wood. Since SammelBot is in creative mode, they're working on getting the blocks directly.
[17:07:32 INFO]: [Not Secure] <SammelBot> I'll gather 10 wood logs and bring them to HandelBot. Let me start by finding and felling the nearest oak tree.
[17:07:38 INFO]: [Not Secure] <HandelBot> I'm waiting at my current position for SammelBot to gather the wood and bring it to me.
[17:07:45 INFO]: [Not Secure] <SammelBot> I'm waiting for the player to potentially change my game mode to survival, or for further instructions on how to proceed with gathering wood in creative mode.
[17:07:52 INFO]: [Not Secure] <HandelBot> I'm waiting here for SammelBot. It seems they're having trouble gathering wood in creative mode since blocks don't drop items. I'll stay at this position until they figure out a solution or receive further instructions from the player.
[17:07:58 INFO]: [Not Secure] <SammelBot> (standing by)
[17:08:05 INFO]: [Not Secure] <HandelBot> I'm standing by with mneuhaus, waiting for SammelBot to resolve the creative mode issue or for new instructions from the player.
