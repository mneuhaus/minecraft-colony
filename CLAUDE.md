## Critical Development Principles

### 0. DESIGNING FOR A BLIND BOT

**The bot cannot see Minecraft's rendered graphics.** All tools must be designed as if the bot is blind, relying only on textual descriptions, coordinates, and numerical data.

#### Key Principles for Tool Design

1. **Always Return Coordinates**
   - Don't say "tree nearby" - say "oak_log at (110, 72, 122)"
   - Include distance in blocks for spatial awareness
   - Provide multiple options sorted by distance (nearest first)

2. **Make Actions Atomic and Clear**
   - Bad: `gather_wood` (combines finding + moving + chopping)
   - Good: `find_tree` (just locate) + `fell_tree` (just chop at given position)
   - Each tool should do ONE thing that's easy to understand

3. **Provide Actionable Data**
   - Return structured info the LLM can act on:
     - Coordinates: `(x, y, z)`
     - Distances: `49 blocks away`
     - Block types: `jungle_log` not just "wood"
     - Multiple options: List of trees sorted by proximity

4. **Think "Blind Navigation"**
   - The bot navigates via coordinates, not by "seeing" trees
   - Pathfinding may fail (water, cliffs) - provide alternatives
   - Sort results to help bot make informed choices

5. **Avoid Ambiguity**
   - Bad: "Found a tree" (where? what kind? how far?)
   - Good: "Found 5 trees. Nearest: jungle_log at (110, 72, 122) - 49 blocks"

#### Example: Tree Gathering Evolution

**V1 (Bad):** Single monolithic tool
```typescript
gather_wood(targetAmount: 10)
// Returns: "Gathered 0 logs"
// Problem: Bot can't see WHY it failed or what to do next
```

**V2 (Better):** Separate find/fell, but limited data
```typescript
find_tree() // Returns: "Found jungle_log 49 blocks away"
// Problem: No coordinates, bot can't act on "49 blocks away"
```

**V3 (Best):** Modular + actionable data
```typescript
find_tree()
// Returns: "Found 5 trees. Nearest: jungle_log at (110, 72, 122) - 49 blocks"
// Bot can: 1) See coordinates to navigate, 2) Pick alternative if path fails

fell_tree(x, y, z, woodType)
// Clear input: exact position to chop
// Bot knows exactly what to do
```

### 0.5. AGENT SKILLS ARCHITECTURE

**Agent Skills** are SKILL.md instruction files that teach Claude HOW to accomplish complex tasks using existing atomic tools. They are NOT hardcoded TypeScript functions.

#### Core Concepts

1. **Skills Are Instructions, Not Code**
   - Skills are markdown files in `.claude/skills/skill-name/SKILL.md`
   - They contain YAML frontmatter + comprehensive strategy documentation
   - Claude reads them to understand HOW to combine atomic tools
   - The actual work is done by calling existing tools (find_tree, dig_block, etc.)

2. **YAML Frontmatter Structure**
   ```yaml
   ---
   name: tree-felling
   description: Efficiently fell trees in Minecraft, handling different tree types (oak, spruce mega trees, acacia), managing height, preventing floating logs, and replanting. Use when gathering wood or managing forests.
   allowed-tools: find_tree, fell_tree, find_block, dig_block, place_block, move_to_position, get_position, list_inventory
   ---
   ```

3. **Key Frontmatter Fields**
   - **name**: Kebab-case identifier for the skill
   - **description**: Critical! Claude uses this to decide when to invoke the skill. Be specific about capabilities and use cases.
   - **allowed-tools**: Restricts which tools Claude can use when this skill is active (optional but recommended)

4. **Model-Invoked Behavior**
   - Skills activate automatically when Claude detects the task matches the description
   - User says "gather wood" → Claude reads tree-felling SKILL.md → follows the strategy
   - Skills are NOT user commands - they're AI-triggered based on description matching

5. **Progressive Disclosure**
   - Main SKILL.md contains overview and general strategy
   - Supporting files in subdirectories provide detailed specifics
   - Claude reads supporting files only when needed
   - Example: `tree_types/oak.md`, `tree_types/spruce.md` for tree-specific details

#### Directory Structure

```
.claude/skills/
├── tree-felling/
│   ├── SKILL.md                    # Main strategy guide
│   └── tree_types/

```

#### What Goes in a SKILL.md

**Good SKILL.md Content:**
- Tree type identification (1x1 vs 2x2 patterns)
- Height assessment strategies (when to pillar)
- Step-by-step procedures (bottom-up vs top-down felling)
- Best practices (sapling replanting, stump prevention)
- Common mistakes to avoid
- Example coordinates and workflows

**Bad SKILL.md Content:**
- ❌ Actual TypeScript function implementations
- ❌ Hardcoded coordinates
- ❌ Tool definitions (tools go in tools.ts)
- ❌ API calls or bot commands

#### Helper Functions Philosophy

**Helper functions should be:**
- **Atomic**: Do one thing clearly
- **Simple**: No complex logic or state management
- **Data-providing**: Return coordinates, measurements, block types
- **LLM-friendly**: Help Claude make decisions, don't make decisions for it

**Example Helper Functions:**
```typescript
// ✅ GOOD: Returns data for LLM to decide
find_tree() // Returns: coordinates + distance + block type

// ✅ GOOD: Simple, clear action
dig_block(x, y, z) // Breaks one specific block

// ❌ BAD: Too complex, makes decisions
gather_wood_intelligently() // Finds, prioritizes, fells, replants automatically

// ❌ BAD: Monolithic
build_shelter() // Does everything from finding location to placing final block
```

**When to Add Helpers:**
- Only after testing reveals gaps in existing tool coverage
- When Claude repeatedly struggles with same calculation (e.g., "is this a 2x2 tree?")
- Keep helpers focused: `check_mega_tree_base(x, y, z)` NOT `handle_all_tree_types()`

#### Creating a New Skill

1. **Create directory structure:**
   ```bash
   mkdir -p .claude/skills/your-skill-name
   ```

2. **Write SKILL.md with frontmatter:**
   ```yaml
   ---
   name: your-skill-name
   description: Clear description of what this skill does and when to use it. Be specific!
   allowed-tools: tool1, tool2, tool3
   ---

   # Your Skill Name

   ## Overview
   Brief description of the skill's purpose.

   ## Strategy
   Step-by-step guide for accomplishing the task.

   ## Common Mistakes
   Pitfalls to avoid.

   ## Example Workflow
   Concrete example with coordinates and tool calls.
   ```

3. **Add supporting documentation if needed:**
   - Create subdirectories for variants (tree_types, shelter_types, etc.)
   - One .md file per variant
   - Include specific measurements, patterns, difficulties

4. **Test the skill:**
   - Start bot
   - Ask Claude to perform the task
   - Verify Claude reads the SKILL.md and follows the strategy
   - Add helper functions ONLY if gaps emerge

#### Example: Tree-Felling Skill

**File:** `.claude/skills/tree-felling/SKILL.md`

**Strategy taught:**
1. Identify tree type (check base for 1x1 or 2x2 pattern)
2. Assess height (count vertical logs)
3. Choose felling method (bottom-up for short, top-down with pillar for tall)
4. Execute felling (dig all logs, handle 2x2 mega trees by clearing all 4 positions)
5. Manage saplings (wait for leaf decay, collect, replant)

**Tools used:** find_tree, fell_tree, find_block, dig_block, place_block, move_to_position, get_position, list_inventory

**Supporting docs:**
- `tree_types/oak.md`: Simple 1x1, 4-7 blocks, easy
- `tree_types/spruce.md`: Normal OR mega (2x2), 7-30 blocks, requires pillaring for mega

**Result:** Claude can autonomously gather wood by reading the strategy and calling the right tools in the right order.

#### Skills vs Tools vs Helpers

| Component | Purpose | Location | Examples |
|-----------|---------|----------|----------|
| **Tools** | Atomic game actions | `src/agent/tools.ts` | dig_block, place_block, find_tree |
| **Helpers** | Simple calculations/checks | `src/agent/tools.ts` or `src/skills/` | check_tree_height, is_mega_tree |
| **Skills** | Strategy documentation | `.claude/skills/*/SKILL.md` | tree-felling, shelter-building |

**Flow:**
1. User: "Gather 20 oak logs"
2. Claude reads `tree-felling/SKILL.md` (matches "gathering wood")
3. Claude follows strategy: find_tree → assess height → dig_block → collect saplings → place_block
4. All actual work done by calling tools

**Key Insight:** Skills make Claude smarter without adding code complexity!

### 1. VISUAL VERIFICATION IS MANDATORY

**Never trust logs alone!** The bot may report success while actually failing silently.

Before fixing any bug related to game state or block placement:
1. **First**: Set up visual verification
2. **Then**: Confirm the actual problem
3. **Finally**: Fix the bug

#### Visual Verification Setup

We use **prismarine-viewer** + **Playwright MCP** for real-time debugging:

```typescript
// In MinecraftBot.ts, add viewer on spawn:
import { mineflayer as mineflayerViewer } from 'prismarine-viewer';

private startViewer(): void {
  if (!this.bot) return;
  try {
    // firstPerson: false gives better overview of structures being built
    mineflayerViewer(this.bot, { port: 3000, firstPerson: false });
    logger.info(`Prismarine viewer started at http://localhost:3000`);
  } catch (error: any) {
    logger.error('Failed to start prismarine viewer', { error: error.message });
  }
}
```

**Camera Controls in Browser:**
- Click and drag: Rotate camera
- Scroll: Zoom in/out
- Right-click and drag: Pan view
- Third-person view (firstPerson: false) recommended for better spatial awareness

**Canvas Dependency Fix:**
```bash
# Canvas needs native bindings - rebuild after install
npm rebuild canvas
# Or build canvas in its directory
cd node_modules/.pnpm/canvas@*/node_modules/canvas && npm run install
```

**Taking Screenshots with Playwright MCP:**
```typescript
// From Claude Code session:
await mcp__playwright__browser_navigate({ url: "http://localhost:3000" });
await mcp__playwright__browser_take_screenshot({ filename: "debug-view.png" });
```

Screenshots saved to: `.playwright-mcp/*.png`

### 2. The Place Block Bug (FIXED)

**Problem:** Bot reported successful block placement but nothing appeared in-game.

**Root Cause:** Face vector was inverted in `place_block` tool.

#### Understanding Mineflayer's placeBlock API

```typescript
bot.placeBlock(referenceBlock, faceVector)
```

- `referenceBlock`: The existing block you're placing AGAINST
- `faceVector`: Direction FROM reference block TO where you want to place

**Our Bug:**
```typescript
// WRONG - faceVec points FROM target TO reference
const faceVec = new Vec3(0, -1, 0); // "bottom" = point down
const referencePos = targetPos.plus(faceVec); // Block below target
bot.placeBlock(referenceBlock, faceVec); // ❌ Wrong direction!
```

**The Fix:**
```typescript
// CORRECT - Negate the vector for placeBlock
const faceVec = new Vec3(0, -1, 0); // Still use for finding reference
const referencePos = targetPos.plus(faceVec);
const placeFaceVec = faceVec.scaled(-1); // ✅ Now points UP (0, 1, 0)
bot.placeBlock(referenceBlock, placeFaceVec); // ✅ Correct!
```

**Location:** `/src/agent/tools.ts:297`

### 3. MCP Tools for Verification

Use Minecraft MCP server to verify actual game state:

```typescript
// Check if block was actually placed
await mcp__minecraft__get_block_info({ x: 88, y: 64, z: 73 });
// Returns: "Found air" or "Found oak_log"

// Check bot position
await mcp__minecraft__get_position();
// Returns: "Current position: (90, 64, 75)"
```

**Lesson:** Always verify with MCP after "successful" operations. Logs can lie!

## Context Management with Subagents

**CRITICAL:** Use the Task tool to launch subagents for context-heavy operations to conserve tokens in the main development loop.

### When to Use Subagents

Launch a subagent (via Task tool) for these scenarios:

1. **Log Analysis**
   - Analyzing large log files (>500 lines)
   - Searching through multiple log files for error patterns
   - Correlating events across log timestamps
   - Example: Finding why gather_wood failed by analyzing agent.log

2. **Screenshot/Image Analysis**
   - Analyzing Playwright screenshots to verify bot behavior
   - Comparing before/after screenshots
   - Identifying visual bugs in prismarine-viewer
   - Example: Verifying blocks were placed correctly at specific coordinates

3. **Code Exploration**
   - Understanding how a system works across multiple files
   - Finding where specific functionality is implemented
   - Tracing execution flow through the codebase
   - Example: Understanding how pathfinder goals work in mineflayer

4. **Multi-File Refactoring**
   - Renaming functions/variables across files
   - Updating imports after file moves
   - Applying consistent patterns across multiple modules

5. **Testing & Debugging**
   - Running tests and analyzing failures
   - Debugging complex issues requiring multiple iterations
   - Testing new skills in isolation

### How to Use Subagents Effectively

```typescript
// ❌ BAD: Reading large log directly in main session
const logs = await Read({ file_path: 'logs/agent.log' }); // 5000 lines!
// Now analyzing in main context...

// ✅ GOOD: Use subagent for log analysis
await Task({
  subagent_type: 'general-purpose',
  description: 'Analyze gather_wood errors',
  prompt: `Read logs/agent.log and find all errors related to the gather_wood skill.

  Report back:
  1. What error occurred?
  2. At what timestamp?
  3. What was the bot's state when it failed?
  4. Root cause analysis

  Keep your response concise - just the key findings.`
});
```

### Subagent Best Practices

1. **Be Specific**: Give subagents clear, focused tasks
2. **Request Summaries**: Ask subagents to return concise findings, not full logs
3. **Limit Scope**: Don't ask subagents to "fix everything" - one task at a time
4. **Use for Heavy Lifting**: Screenshots, logs, multi-file searches
5. **Main Loop for Decisions**: Use main session for high-level planning and decisions

### Example Workflows

#### Debugging gather_wood Failure

```typescript
// Main loop: Identify issue
"gather_wood returned error, let me investigate"

// Subagent: Analyze logs
await Task({
  subagent_type: 'general-purpose',
  description: 'Analyze gather_wood error',
  prompt: 'Read logs/agent.log, find the gather_wood error, and report:
    1. Error message
    2. Stack trace if present
    3. Last successful tool call before error
    Respond with just these 3 items.'
});

// Subagent reports: "pathfinder.goto threw error: No path found"

// Main loop: Fix the issue
"Now I know it's a pathfinding issue, let me check if trees are out of range..."
```

#### Visual Verification with Screenshots

```typescript
// Main loop: Need to verify bot behavior visually
"Bot claims it placed blocks, let me verify with screenshot"

// Subagent: Take and analyze screenshot
await Task({
  subagent_type: 'general-purpose',
  description: 'Verify block placement',
  prompt: `
    1. Navigate to http://localhost:3000 using Playwright MCP
    2. Take screenshot: verify-blocks.png
    3. Check if blocks exist at coordinates (85,64,71) to (87,65,73)
    4. Report: Did blocks get placed? What does the structure look like?

    Keep response to 2-3 sentences.
  `
});

// Subagent reports: "Screenshot shows 4 oak_log blocks at corners. Walls incomplete."

// Main loop: Continue based on findings
"Blocks placed successfully at corners. Need to fill in walls between..."
```

### Token Savings

By offloading heavy operations to subagents:
- **Log analysis**: Save ~5000+ tokens per log file
- **Screenshot analysis**: Save ~2000+ tokens per image
- **Code exploration**: Save ~10000+ tokens for multi-file searches
- **Main loop stays focused**: Keep context for high-level logic and decisions

### Warning Signs You Need a Subagent

- Reading files over 1000 lines in main session
- Analyzing multiple screenshots
- Searching through >5 files for something
- Iterating on the same debugging task >3 times
- Main conversation context approaching 100k tokens

**Remember:** Subagents are disposable - use them liberally for heavy lifting!

## Development Workflow

### Standard Debug Process

1. **Reproduce the issue**
   - Run the bot: `pnpm start`
   - Observe behavior in-game or viewer

2. **Visual Verification**
   - Open http://localhost:3000 in browser
   - Use Playwright MCP for screenshots
   - Use MCP get-block-info to verify state

3. **Identify Root Cause**
   - Check logs for patterns
   - Compare reported success vs actual state
   - Use screenshots to see what's really happening

4. **Fix and Test**
   - Make code changes
   - Rebuild: `pnpm run build`
   - Restart bot and verify fix with screenshots

### Common Gotchas

1. **Canvas Module Issues**
   - Symptom: `Cannot find module 'canvas'`
   - Fix: `npm rebuild canvas`

2. **False Success Reports**
   - Bot logs "success" but nothing happens
   - Always verify visually + MCP tools

3. **Coordinate Systems**
   - Y=63: Usually ground level
   - Y=64+: Above ground (where walls should go)
   - Bot position vs block placement reach (~4.5 blocks)

4. **Face Vectors**
   - Review the placeBlock fix above carefully
   - Test with simple block placement before complex builds

- `ClaudeAgent.ts`: Tool execution loop - handles timeouts and retries
- `MinecraftBot.ts`: Event handlers and viewer - keep viewer active

## Testing Checklist

Before considering any block placement feature "done":

- [ ] Visual confirmation via prismarine-viewer (http://localhost:3000)
- [ ] Screenshot taken with Playwright MCP
- [ ] MCP get-block-info verification shows correct block type
- [ ] Bot can place blocks at Y=64 and above
- [ ] Multiple blocks can be placed in sequence
- [ ] Blocks placed near bot (< 4.5 block radius)
- [ ] No timeout errors in logs

## Useful Commands

```bash
# Development
pnpm run dev              # Watch mode with tsx
pnpm run build            # Compile TypeScript
pnpm start                # Run compiled bot

# Debugging
lsof -i :3000            # Check if viewer port is in use
npm rebuild canvas       # Fix canvas native module

# Clean restart
rm -rf dist && pnpm run build && pnpm start
```

## Future Improvements

### Potential Features
- [ ] Add more building shapes (roof, door, windows)
- [ ] Pathfinding integration for complex builds
- [ ] Material inventory management
- [ ] Multi-story building support
- [ ] Automatic screenshot on errors

### Known Limitations
- Bot reach is ~4.5 blocks (move closer for distant placements)
- Only 15 oak logs in starting inventory
- No automatic material gathering yet
- Viewer doesn't show real-time updates (refresh browser)

## Success Metrics

**This bot is working when:**
1. Visual viewer at localhost:3000 shows structures
2. In-game player can see the built structures
3. MCP verification confirms blocks exist
4. No timeout errors in logs
5. Bot completes building tasks autonomously
