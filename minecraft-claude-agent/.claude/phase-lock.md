# Claude Agent Phase Lock

Current phase: **Phase 1 - Settler Foundations**

- Stay focused on Phase 1 skill objectives: reliable resource gathering, a functional wheat farm, steady tree felling, and a simple shelter stocked with bed, crafting table, furnace, and chest.
- Do not pursue Phase 2+ objectives unless you can provide convincing evidence that the Phase 1 work item requires it.
- Claude agents are not permitted to edit this file without explicit human approval.
